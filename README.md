# Home Battery Control via Home Assistant & Node-RED

Home Battery Control is an open-source solution for the community to control home batteries and electric vehicles using Home Assistant and Node-RED. Control your batteries exactly how you want, all in one place without vendor lock-ins.

This project is designed for hobbyists who want full control over their home battery systems. It provides ready-to-use flows and configuration examples, including a PID controller for advanced battery management. Use at your own discretion.

## Features
- **You don't need to be a programmer**
- **Node-RED Control Flows:** Easy to import and use control flows for battery charge/discharge ([node-red/](node-red/))
- **Home Assistant Integration:** Premade dashboard for onboarding and control. Example configuration files included. ([home assistant/](home%20assistant/))
- **Customizable:** Tweakers? Adapt the flows and configuration to your specific battery hardware and automation needs
- **Multiple Strategies:** [Self-consumption](docs/04-setup-self-consumption.md) (use your own energy), [Timed](node-red/02%20strategy-timed.json), [Dynamic](docs/05-setup-dynamic.md) (price-based), [Charge](node-red/02%20strategy-charge.json), [Sell](node-red/02%20strategy-sell.json), [Charge PV](node-red/02%20strategy-charge-pv.json) (solar-only), [Full Stop](node-red/02%20strategy-full-stop.json). Easily add your own. See [all strategies](docs/03-strategies.md).
- **Easy Updates:** Grab the latest control flow without losing your personal configurations

### Installation Summary
1. **Connect your batteries to HA** - e.g. use ESPhome or LilyGo to connect batteries to Home Assistant (see [Modbus setup guide](docs/02-modbus-setup.md))
1. **Install Node-RED** - [Install in Home Assistant](https://zachowj.github.io/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket/guide/installation.html)
1. **Clone this repository** - `git clone https://github.com/gitcodebob/marstek-venus-rs485-node-red.git`
1. **Configure Home Assistant** - Import YAML files from `home assistant/` folder
1. **Import Node-RED flows** - Import control flows from `node-red/` folder
1. **Set up strategies** - Choose and configure your preferred control strategy

📖 **[Complete Getting Started Guide](docs/01-getting-started.md)**

### Safety First
> **Disclaimer:** You are responsible for configuring and operating your system safely. Monitor carefully. Be prepared to switch off battery control or disengage physically.

- The P1 value is expected in Watt (W). If your meter supplies kW, multiply the P1 input × 1000
- **Test your first setup in 800W mode**
- Set appropriate Max. Charge and Max. Discharge values for each battery via the dashboard
- Always consult a professional electrician when going above 800W
