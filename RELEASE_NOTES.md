# Release Notes
All releases follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer). Every release provides a fresh `home assistant/dashboard.yaml` to import.

## 4.8.2
- **Feat: High load detection reduces update rate**
  * When excessive system load is detected, the control loop update rate is automatically throttled down.
  * Together with the fixes below, this may address situations where Node-RED completely grinds to a halt due to excessive load and error storms.

- **Fix: Unhandled exceptions no longer trigger the 'Missing return' warning**
  * Exceptions in function nodes are now caught and handled, preventing spurious 'Missing return' warnings from polluting the debug log.

- **Fix: Catch node scoping on Start flow and Self-consumption flow**
  * Catch nodes were incorrectly scoped, causing unintended error capture across flows.

- **Fix: Bumpless Ki working again**
  * Bumpless integral gain (Ki) initialization is restored to correct behavior.

- **Files Changed:**
  - `home assistant/dashboard.yaml`
  - `node-red/01 start-flow.json`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-charge-pv.json`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-charge.json`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-dynamic.json`

  - `node-red/02 strategy-self-consumption.json`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-sell.json`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-timed.json`

## 4.8.1
- **Fix: Correct entities in dashboard history-graph**
  * The PID history-graph was referencing a non-existent `sensor.pid_output` for PID control, and the `input_number` for PID was mislabelled as "Grid power".
  * Fixed to use `input_number.house_battery_control_pid_output` for PID control and `sensor.p1_meter_power` for grid power.

- **Files Changed:**
  - `home assistant/dashboard.yaml`

## 4.8.0
- **Feat: Auto balance battery priority cycle — fixes #114 #113**
  * New **Auto balance** option for the battery priority cycle setting.
  * Rotates battery priority every 30 minutes, spreading the energy reserve more evenly across all batteries throughout the day.
  * This maximizes combined charge and discharge power delivery when batteries would otherwise drift to different SoC levels.
  * When Auto balance is active, the _reverse discharge priority_ optimization is automatically disabled, as it conflicts with balanced multi-battery operation.
  * Daily and Weekly cycle options trigger at 02:00, this is unchanged

- **Files Changed:**
  - `home assistant/dashboard.yaml`
  - `home assistant/packages/house_battery_control.yaml`
  - `node-red/01 start-flow.json`

  - `home assistant/packages/house_battery_control.yaml`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-self-consumption.json`

## 4.7.0
- **Feat: Multi-battery support extended from 4 to 6 (M5–M6) — fixes #103**
  * HBC now supports up to 6 batteries (M1–M6) out of the box with glance cards and per-battery configuration grids.
  * Three phase homes using 2 batteries per phase, can now use HBC without modification.
  * Thanks to _nickles-lee_ for the PR (#104) and _Stievo9997_ for field-testing with 6 batteries.

- **Files Changed:**
  - `home assistant/dashboard.yaml`
  - `home assistant/packages/house_battery_control.yaml`

## 4.6.3
- **Fix: EV trigger template fallback**
  * Fixed a bug in the EV is charging template using an undefined variable `bron_entity_id`.
  * Also fixed duplicate and incorrect dampening warning conditions on the dashboard.
  * Thanks to _yavasura_ for the PR (#117).

- **Fix: Invalid states in 2 template sensors**
  * `sensor.charge_remaining_energy` and `sensor.house_total_battery_power_in_w` could return the literal string `"unavailable"` instead of being properly unavailable.
  * Fixed using the `availability:` key. Thanks to _satscan_ for reporting.

- **Fix: Missing icon in self-consumption power saving log**
  * A log remark was missing its icon. Thanks to _adjego_ for reporting.

- **Fix: Zonneplan data source failing during DST transition**
  * The Zonneplan data source broke at the DST clock change due to incorrect hour handling.
  * Thanks to _MarckNL_ for reporting.

- **Chore: PID output on dashboard shows rounded numbers**
  * The history-graph now shows the PID output as whole numbers (W) for a cleaner graph.
  * Thanks to _BigTasty_ for reporting.

## 4.6.2
- **Fix: UTF-8 encoding in release scripts corrupting emoji icons**
  * A script used in development was breaking emoji characters (⚪ℹ️🔧⚠️❌).
  * Restored corrupted emoji icons in `all-flows-in-one-file.json`.

- **Fix: Align chargingLimiter with battery specifications**
  * The software charging limiter was more aggressive than the battery's own BMS limiter present in newer firmware versions, causing unnecessarily slow charging near full SoC.
  * New thresholds: 1500W at 95% SoC, 1000W at 99% SoC (was: 1500W at 85%, 500W at 95%, 300W at 98%).
  * Thanks goes out to _Gely_ and others for noting this.

- **Fix: Lower minimum SoC cutoff from 12% to 11%**
  * Updated discharging cutoff capacity minimum for all batteries (M1–M4) from 12% to 11%.
  * This should increase your usable energy by 1%. 
  * Thanks goes out to _Fonske_ et. al. for pointing this out.
  * `Note 1` requires manually setting SoC to 11% for each existing battery.
  * `Note 2` Please let us know your results. 11% should work for Marstek Venus E v1/v2/v3. And is expected to work on other models. 
  * See [Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/1422227123925680228/1422227124391252080/1486096929841483858) for more background.

## 4.6.1
- **Fix: Solar forecast sensor not updating when forecast value changed**
  * The template trigger used to watch the solar forecast entity was unreliable — it only fires on false→true transitions, not on every value change. Replaced with a `time_pattern` trigger (every 15 min).
  * Changed the default solar forecast fallback to `sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_remaining_today` for better intraday accuracy (remaining forecast vs. full day).
  * Removed `initial` values from solar forecast `input_text` entities to prevent user settings being overwritten on every HA restart.

- **Files Changed:**
  - `home assistant/dashboard.yaml`
  - `home assistant/packages/house_battery_control.yaml`

## 4.6.0
- **Feature: Solar forecast aware charging (Solcast)**
  * Batteries automatically leave room to store solar surplus on sunny days, and charge more from the grid on cloudy days.
  * Minimize PV export while ensuring there is always plenty of energy in your battery.
  * Find it under `Charge/Sell tab` > `Charge until solar forecast`

  * It's pre-configured with the recommended [Solcast PV Forecast](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar) integration (`sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_today`)
  * Works with _any other solar forecast_ integration you provide! Just provide a daily kWh forecast sensor.

  - `home assistant/dashboard.yaml`
  - `home assistant/packages/house_battery_control.yaml`
  - `node-red/01 start-flow.json`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-charge.json`

## 4.5.2
- **Fix: Negative, None and 0 cents energy price handling in Dynamic strategy**
  * Fix by *yavasura* for None values
  * Fix negative price compatibility

- **Files Changed:**
  - `home assistant/packages/house_battery_control.yaml`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-dynamic.json`

## 4.5.1
- **Tweak: AC power displayed on dashboard**
  * At the main dashboard, the batteries now show the AC power instead of DC power.
  * AC is simpler and more logical for users to understand. e.g. Charging at 800W now displays 800W instead of 723W (the net internal battery power)
  * Note: the sign has flipped. Positive is now battery consumption, negative is battery charging.

- **Fix: Nordpool (core) dynamic price loading (fixes #91)**
  * Split combined "Tibber, Nordpool (core)" option into separate "Tibber (core)" and "Nordpool (core)" entries
  * Resolves price data not loading correctly for Nordpool (core) users
  * Added setup instructions for Nordpool (core) using the Cheapest Energy Hours blueprint

- **Files Changed:**
  - `home assistant/dashboard.yaml`
  - `home assistant/packages/house_battery_control.yaml`
  - `node-red/02 strategy-dynamic.json`

## 4.5.0
- **Feature: Peak Shaving & grid limits**
  * When Peak Shaving you utilize your batteries (when able) to reduce import/export peaks on your grid connections
  * Ideal for 'capacity tariff' contracts (aka CAPTAR, capaciteitstarief)
  * Or to reduce risk of blowing fuses when using multiple heavy appliances (EV, heat-pumps) under changing PV conditions
  * Note: all strategies seamlessly allow peak shaving to take control. Excl. Full Stop, which takes precedence.
  * Note: configurable grid power limits for both import and export thresholds
  * Note: captar usually only requires _import_ limiting
  * Disclaimer: peak shaving is not a safeguard or replacement for peak protection, overload protection or fuses.

- **Improvements: Power limit configuration**
  * Refactored power limit settings from strategy-specific to global configuration
  * Charge and Sell strategies now use centralized grid power limits
  * The limits can now be found on the settings tab
  * Onboarding now contains a step to review battery and grid limits 

- **Fix: Removed deprecated Zonneplan workaround**
  * Removed "Zonneplan (one)" data source option - no longer needed after sensor naming was fixed

- **Fix: Missing icons**
  * Added missing icons to various UI elements

- **Discussion points**
  * Charge / Sell perform power limiting, but do not peak shave until they reach their charge/sell goal. 
    * E.g. Charge does not discharge to help peak shave unless it's desired SoC/reserve has been reached.
  * A lack of available capacity or charge to perform the peak shaving is not communicated to the user.
    * E.g. if your batteries are empty, they cannot perform an import peak shave. This can be inferred, but is not explicitly visible.

## 4.0.0
- **Feat: Add visual flow execution tracking and detailed logging to dashboard**
  * **Visual flow execution tracking** - You can now see which strategy flows your system executed and in what order, helping you understand the decision-making process in real-time
  * **Execution time transparency** - Each flow step displays its duration in seconds, allowing you to identify if any part of your system is running slower than expected
  * **Performance insights** - The "Total" execution time at the bottom of the trace shows you how long your entire battery control cycle takes, helping to identify fitting rate limits
  * **Detailed explanations in plain language** - The system now logs human-readable explanations of what it's doing, color-coded by severity (info=teal, log=green, warn=orange, error=red), with emoji indicators for quick scanning
  * **Troubleshooting made easy** - When something isn't working as expected, you can toggle Debug Mode on to see up to 100 detailed log entries showing what decisions the system made and why
  * **Battery operation clarity** - Specific logs explain why each battery was charged, discharged, skipped, or stopped, including SoC percentages and power levels
  * **Strategy switching transparency** - You can now see why the system switched between strategies (e.g., from default to expensive period) with tariff comparisons and price deltas
  * **Auto-disable safety feature** - Debug mode automatically turns off after 5 minutes to prevent performance degradation from excessive logging
  * **Clearer errors/warnings** - When *expected errors* occur, the log explains exactly what's wrong and which flow/node encountered the problem
  * **Cleaner logbook** - Debug sensors are excluded from Home Assistant's main logbook to prevent clutter while still being accessible in the Debug dashboard

- **Tweaks and fixes**
